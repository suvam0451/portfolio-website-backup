This guide is about **location** of Visual Studio Code extensions files.
This guide will also tell you about which files you need for adding your templates.
This should help you find the JSON files used to add your mods.

However, **this guide will be for windows only**. I have no idea where they are stored in MacOS/Linux.
Any pointers towards that would be appreciated.

### Installation Location

---

After adding an extension, the files can be found in

- **C:/Users/{Username}/.vscode** for Visual Studio Code
- **C:/Users/{Username}/.vscode-insiders** for Visual Studio Code Insiders

You would be interested in the following folders

#### 1. Snippets

---

Browse this to view the snippets.
If a large number of snippets were added and the documentation was not updates,
here's where you'll find them.

#### 2. out/data

---

This folder contains the default JSON files that ship with the extension. **You don't want to modify these**,
unless you have a hang of how the API works.

#### 3. out/data/extensions

---

This folder contains files that are available to you to add your templates.
For a comprehensive guide on the various modules available for modding and how-tos, follow these links

- [adding header pack](/docs/trailblazer/adding-header-packs)
- [add/make buildspaces](/docs/trailblazer/extending-the-buildspace)

### List of files

---

These files in first column are shipped by default with extension.
**Try not to mess these up**.
The corresponding mod files are listed in second column
(all inside the extension folder)

| Shipped Defaults               | Extension File                           |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| out/data/BuildTemplates.json   | out/data/extensions/Buildspace.json      |
| out/data/ContextAutofill.json  | out/data/extensions/ContextFill_Ext.json |
| out/data/headerFunctions.json  | out/data/extensions/Functions_Ext.json   |
| out/data/includeTemplates.json | out/data/extensions/Include_Ext.json     |

Tour is over and you are ready to start modding. Jump into any of the following guides to get started

- [Extending header packs](/docs/trailblazer/adding-header-packs)
- [Extending buildspaces](/docs/trailblazer/extending-the-buildspace)
- [Customizing exclusions](/docs/trailblazer/workspace-configurations)

#### Other files

---

A little but about what the other files are doing, if you curious

- The files in **templates folder** are used to generate the folder structure for AssetStreams.
- **search-engine** folder has files thast I will use later to provide error wiki features (hopefully).
- **generators** has class generation data* (Used by Class generator module)*

See you later... 🖐
