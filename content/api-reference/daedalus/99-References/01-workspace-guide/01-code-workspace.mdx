The .code-workspace file contains information about resource directories
and settings that **apply to the whole workspace**.

**A Workspace** in itself comprises of a list of folders which can then be browsed/referenced etc.

The actual bulk of the settings for your Unreal engine is actually in
**c_cpp_properties.json** file in **.vscode folder** _(might be hidden)_

### Fields explained

---

##### folders

The generated workspace file always contains the path to the current dirtectory
AND the path to your current engine version. Since, this key is required by the extension,
if you choose to **right click** --> **Open with VSCode** from the project folder, certain features might misbehave.

##### settings

Aside the many many settings vscode exposes,
we have our own extension settings that you can choose to override.

If you do not prefer setting values through the UI,
here is the list of settings and what they are used for in our extension.

### Extension settings

---

Here are the settings that ship with trailblazer.

##### **assetFolders**

A string **list of full paths** to all the asset folders you need the extension to track.
If this is new to you, see
By dfault, this is empty.

##### **allowUserExtensions**

Your custom written JSON mods won't work without this flag set to true. By default this is set to false.

##### **excludedExtensions**

Since some users might choose to include .uasset files for quick search anyways, this option is left for you to customize binary files you wish to exclude.
By default, { "dll", "lib" } are excluded. That said, binary files don't affect intellisense. This is purely an option to tidy up your dev environment a bit more.

##### **excludeEditorClassesFromWorkspace**

If you are not working on extending the editor, you might want to exclude these classes to lighten up.
_Editor classes are not needed when scripting gameplay_. False by default. Recommended kept false.

##### **hideEditorClassesFromWorkspace**

Same as above but only excludes editor classes from search. The workspace benefits from

##### **autoAddFunctionsInSource**

Option to choose whether function definition is automatically aded in header or copied to your clipboard.
You might want to choose the latter if the former causes trouble for your workflow. Defaults to true.
