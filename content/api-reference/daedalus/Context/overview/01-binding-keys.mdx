The commandlet under question is by default available as a menu extension under the name **UE4: Initialize by Context**.
You can get contextual completion through right-click menu as well, but we would preferably want a key-binding for that.

![context menu](../../../../images/DaedalusAPI/context-module/contextmenu.png)

### Binding the keys

---

The settings for key-bindings can be obtained at **File** --> **Preferences** --> **Keyboard Shortcuts**

Find the command in the list and assign a key binding that does not conflict with any other important keybindings. (Or which ever you are comfortable with)

![binding the key](../../../../images/DaedalusAPI/context-module/keybindings.png)

Thats it. You can now access almost the entire extension from this key binding. 
To learn the contexts in which specific commands get called, head to [activation context](/docs/trailblazer/context-keys/2).

See you later... 🖐
