In this section, I am going to discuss about the context on which each command is activated when you run your context key.
Getting the predictable obvious lines of code filled up for you helps with flow and concentration.

Moreover, by getting acquainted to these contexts will make sure you have less errors and better efficiency.

That said, it is very important what a line of code does and what will happen if you omit important lines of code.
These are discoveries you have to make naturally when covering uncharted territories.

...but for now, lets be the swiftest hands in town and understand our tools.

### Activation criteria

---

Following are short notes for each module specifying compatible locations from which commands get activated.

### 1. Header module

---

This runs the `Daedalus : Include Header` command. Activation checks the current line for 
- **#include xyz.h** (current position)
- **#include xyz.generated.h** (for header)
- **#include filename.h** (for source)

It then adds headers **before .generated.h** for header and **after filename.h** for source. Duplicated are matched literally.

It also checks for duplicates in the same file. **It does not check for duplicates in both .h/.cpp files.**
For more info on why you declaring on .cpp is more efficient, read [forward declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_declaration).

```cpp
#include "GameFramework/Controller.h" // YES
#include "Kismet/KismetMathLibrary.h" // YES
#include "GameFramework/SpringArmComponent.h" // YES
// NO

# include "RandomStuff.h" // YES, but might get confused about the order
```

**When called normally** : Will check the current file line-line and detect locations automatically. Then it will open up the menu. 

### 2. Function body generator

---

This gets called as a part of the pattern matching list that occurs when **UE4 : Initialize by Context** is called.
This takes into account { const, INLINE, override}

- It first tokenizes 1.return value, 2.function body, 3.extra identifiers
- It strips { INLINE, override }. Also removes default values
- Looks just outside the bracket scope and gives you the function

```cpp
virtual void Tick(float delta) override; // YES
virtual void BeginPlay() override // NO (No semi-colon)
TMap<int, FyComplexClas> MyComplexFunc(int mine = 19, TArray<int, FString>) const; // YES

AMyActorConstructor(); // NO (Constructors are excluded... for now)
```

**When called normally** : Cannot be called normally

### 3. Component Initializer

---

This detects commonly used components declarations in header and generates initializers for them.
The code might be opinionated, but I have tried to fill the tables using my limited experience.
Please let me know if improvements can be made


**Note: Currently initialization code is generated for constructor (CreateDefaultSubObject). This will change soon and NewObject will also be supported.**

**When called normally** : Cannot be called normally. 

### 4. Context keywords

---

Context keywords can be found sprinkled throughout the snippet library. Since **snippets cannot be easily modified at runtime**(unaware of local symbols),
hint text is provided for you to take action and fill the gaps. This is optional so you don't end up with tons of redundant debug/scaffold code.

The context for this is simple. The current line must be UXYZComponent* MyCompName.
This means, you should make your derived component follow same patterns to get registered.

```cpp
UPROPERTY() // Not needed
class UCameraComponent *FollowCamera; // YES

// generates
FollowCamera = CreateDefaultSubobject<UCameraComponent>("MyCamera");
FollowCamera->AttachToComponent(RootComponent, FAttachmentTransformRules::KeepRelativeTransform);

class UMyCustomComp *CustomComp; // NO. Should be a Component
```
**Note** : This **copies the code to the clipboard**. Since multi-window workspaces are normal in VSCode, you can paste and continue.

Also, complete symbol parsing can be done to automatically detect the components irrespective of names. However, unfortunately,
that is currently out of my expertise and not a worthwhile time investment for me since this is very efficient.

**When called normally** : Cannot be called normally.


### Design 

---

My current goals are to expand the library to cover more classes first.
If you have any ideas about awesome features you would like to be added, please join my discord and let me know.

See you later... 🖐

### More Technical details

---

When you press the context key, a series of **tricky regex matches** are carried out, which parse symbols if successful.
Based on the results an action is selected. By default the following self-explanatory actions are provided

- **edit**
- **copy**
- **replace**

For anything else, **custom individual commands** get called. **The tab insertion/calculation** is auto handled.
The line insertion is also auto handled.
You just need to map the parsed symbols to slots in the strings.

An simple entry for component handling (default copy action)
```json
{
	"id": "init_components",
	"desc": "Initialization Scene/Sphere/StaticMesh etc",
	"pattern": ".*?U([a-zA-Z_]*)?Component[\\*| ]{2}([a-zA-Z_]*);",
	"parsemap": [
		1,
		2
	],
	"body": [
		"$2 = CreateDefaultSubobject<U$1Component>(\"My$1\");",
		"$2->AttachToComponent(RootComponent, FAttachmentTransformRules::KeepRelativeTransform);"
	],
	"action": "copy"
}
```

An example entry for function generation (uniquely handled to remove some symbols and remove defaults)

```json
{
	"id": "functionbodygen",
	"desc": "Generates function body for a target line.",
	"pattern": "(FORCEINLINE )?(virtual )?([a-z_A-Z<>,]*) ?([a-zA-Z_, <>(=0-9\" ]*\\))( const)?( override)?;",
	"parsemap": [
		2,
		3,
		4,
		5
	],
	"body": [
		"$1$2 $x::$3$4 {",
		"\t// Function not implemented",
		"}"
	],
	"action": "fnbodygen"
},
```

If this interests you, you can use the API to add your own contextual code-completion. **Coming Soon**


...Please consider **sending back** some of those definitions you make. It helps everybody.

See you later... 🖐
