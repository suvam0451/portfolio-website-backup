### Performance

---

**Edit:** Update v0.6.12 brought majort performance improvements.
The previous benchmarks and faq is no longer valid since the current performance is much much better that what it was in v0.6.0.
The startup times and overhead has been drastically reduced thanks to full webpack integration.

**Q. Provide an honest estimate of general performance ?**

The updated settings significantly improve the coding workflow. You might encounter pauses of 2-3 seconds after adding multiple headers, but that's it.

**Q. How does the VSCode workflow compare to VS in terms of performance ?**

VSCode is great for scripting. If you already know the codes and classes, you are going to get a significant boost in productivity
thanks to contextual auto-completion and tons of snippets. I am trying to integrate more and more convenience features that VAX and VS intellisense provide you.

I already have function body declaration, variable initialization and all those UE4 specific stuff integrated.

However, due noting that in VS, the information about all the files is pre-cached. (Hence the high start-up times).
I would only switch to VS when exploring new classes like AI and gameplay ability due to faster navigation.

**Q. I still have poor performance with the extension installed.**

Highly probably that the cause is other conflicting extensions. I recommend {C#, C++, Sleeping Forest} only. Try deactivating others for the workspace.

**Q. Very poor performance of VSCode in general, even with my extension.**

I don't claim VSCode to be the best code editor in the programming world. Emacs already got that honor.
A fucking operating system in a text editor is legendary.

...All I ask if a fair chance.

### Legal

---

**Q. To what extent does MPL-v2 license limit my usage of the extension ?**

You can use the extension **for free, personal, or commercial project**. There is frankly no restrictions in that sense.
All I want is to restrict monetization of modified versions **of my code**. So, no limits if you are a normal user.
You **can't make money from mods** you make. (You **can internally share** modifed version within team/group ).
Also, you can't change the license if you fork the project. It should be always free for everyone.

**tl;dr**: Unlike libraries, It's a fully featured service. I just want to avoid exploits.

**Q. Is this extension free ? What are funding plans ?**

Yes and always will be. Although I would probably charge for a heavily customized build.

**Q. Do I have to credit you or your code ?**

**No**. Appreciated, though. Use it and help me make it better. That's it.
