### ugs_objectfind

Used to load assets by path in C++ code. Try not to load assets directly in C++ like this(except data assets). There are better options available.

- **\$1**: Pick a decent(disposable) name for object.
- **\$2**: Location of asset (See extra info).
- **\$3**: Object type
- **\$4**: Where to cast after null-check (If you skip null-check and don't get reference, a warning will be thrown).

```cpp
static ConstructorHelpers::FObjectFinder<${3:UStaticMesh}> ${1:UniqueName}(TEXT("/Game/$2"));
if(${1:UniqueName} != null) {
    ${4:TargetObject} = ${1:UniqueName}.Object;
}
```

- We also need **_"ConstructorHelpers.h"_**. Done automatically if using commandlet.
- If you don't have any plug-ins, assets can be listed at **_"/Game/YourFolder/YourItem"_**.
- For plug-in content, Path = **_"/PluginName/YourFolder/YourItem"_**
- Don't add "\_C"(This is only for BP classes) or "StaticMesh.YourMesh_C"(This is outdated syntax))

Many times, it is a better idea to load the assets asynchronously.

You can read my tutorial about asynchronous loading here(coming soon).

#### Example use case

Here we are getting a mesh in C++ directly.

```cpp{3, 21}
// header

// Note how the reference doesn't have to be public.
private:
    UPROPERTY()
        UStaticMesh *AutoReference;


// source

static ConstructorHelpers::FObjectFinder<UStaticMesh> tmp(TEXT("/Game/Meshes/MyCube"));
if(tmp != null) {
    AutoReference = tmp.Object;
}

// source(inline)

AutoReference = ConstructorHelpers::FObjectFinder<UStaticMesh> tmp(TEXT("/Game/$2")).Object;

// Don't use the above. Without null checks, it is hard to debug other features
// because the code will reach breakpoints.
// Always deal with null references as they come.
```
