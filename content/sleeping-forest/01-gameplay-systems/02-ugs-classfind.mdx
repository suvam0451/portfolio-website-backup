### ugs_classfind

Used to load classes**_(One of few ways to load BP classes into C++)_**.

- **\$1**: Name for object _(temporary)_.
- **\$2**: Location of asset _(See notes)_.
- **\$3**: TargetClass _(or its ParentClass)_
- **\$4**: Target _(See notes)_.

```cpp
static ConstructorHelpers::FClassFinder<${3:ParentClass}> ${1:UniqueName}(TEXT("/Game/$2"));
if(${1:UniqueName} != null) {
    ${4:TargetSubClassOf} = ${1:UniqueName}.Class;
}
```

- We need both a null check and a cast check.
- **\$4** may be defined in header as `TSubClassOf<ACharacter>`
- You can cast the output to a child class of ParentClass _(once again, don't neglect the checks)_.
- (If you skip null-check and don't get reference, a warning will be thrown)
