Snippets are the bread and butter of any editor extension. The snippets shipped with this extension all start with `u` _(to avoid conflicts)_.
This is except a few macros like loops and switch statements which go along with any extension.

**NOTE:** The only linters available in VSCode are `Clang-format` and `C++ tools`. And they will revert the tabs _(Like the tabs under UPROPERTY())_.
You might want to disable them, or even better, go along it.

Snippets are listed into the following categories with their own namespaces and can be called by `unamespace_xyz`.

### How to use

---

While scripting, you will start to see snippets very often like this _(squares)_.
If not, you should give the namespaces a quick look to have an idea of what keywords are expected.

![snippet shape](../../../images/sleeping-forest-ue4/02/SnippetShape.png)

There are stops along the snippets you have to tab through. Fill a value, tab, fill next value.

However, some snippets will provide you options to select like the following.
You have to select the option and then **tab to continue** to next stop

![snippet choice](../../../images/sleeping-forest-ue4/02/SnippetChoice.png)

For example, in `ufunc` macro, you first select the function type and the select the return type and then the name.
You can leave at any time by clicking elsewhere.

### Contextual modification

---

Many of the snippets will be internally bound to the `context key`. You should have a lookout for situations like these.
These are some examples, you will find a better overview at [context keys...](/docs/sleeping-forest/context-keys/2)

**1. UPROPERTY specifiers can be cycled through**. This is one-way behaviour. You have to Ctrl +Z to return back. Press it 3+ times for no specifiers.

![flipping uproperty](../../../images/sleeping-forest-ue4/02/upropflip.gif)

**2. Copy code for Component declarations**. Every component needs to be initialized,
registered and attached to a SceneComponent to be visible. Context keys make it simple for any _componenent_.

![flipping uproperty](../../../images/sleeping-forest-ue4/02/component_init.gif)

As you can see, the name used matches the name you gave and everything else if auto-determined.
Anyways, you get the idea. **Full list is covered in the context key segment.**

Now go explore the namespaces and remember to call them in code. I update the list every now and then so always check the changelogs for wiki updates !!!

See you later... üñê
