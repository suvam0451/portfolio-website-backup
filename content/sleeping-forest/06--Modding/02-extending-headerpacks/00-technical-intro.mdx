The headerpacks are implemented as an easy way to add necessary headers for those who might not know the relative paths.

You can add and share your own definitions, for headers we might have missed.

### The definitions

---

```json
{
	"id": "AIPerception",
	"headers": [
		"Perception/AIPerceptionComponent.h",
		"Perception/AISense_Damage.h",
		"Perception/AISense_Hearing.h",
		"Perception/AISense_Sight.h",
		"Perception/AISense_Team.h",
		"Perception/AISenseConfig_Damage.h",
		"Perception/AISenseConfig_Hearing.h",
		"Perception/AISenseConfig_Sight.h",
		"Perception/AISenseConfig_Team.h"
	]
},
{
	"id": "Math",
	"headers": ["Kismet/KismetMathLibrary.h"]
},
```

A simple format, with **id** being the label that is visible to the user and **headers** being the list of headers.

No plans to make it like buildspaces, because with a little bit of help from you guys, **we can cover the entire engine** in the default file itself.

In any case, we provide **Include_Ext.json**, in case you might want to add your own definitions.

That's it for this one.

See you later... üñê
