Function definitions for engine classes are manually defined by the dev team for consistency.
However, **you can add any functions** _(not just engine functions)_ into the global list.

### The syntax

---

The default function templates can be found at **FunctionTemplates.json**. An example entry goes as follows

```json
{
	"id": "GetControlRotation",
	"comment": "// This goes in header above function",
	"signature": "virtual FRotator GetControlRotation() const override;",
	"field": "private",
	"body": [
		"if(GetPawn() != nullptr){",
		"return FRotator(0.0f, GetPawn()->GetActorRotation().Yaw, 0.0f);",
		"}",
		"else{",
		"return FRotator(0.0f);",
		"}"
	]
},
```

#### Few things to note

- the **id** is used in the buildspace definitions. **The strings must match**.
- **field** indicates which field _{public, private, protected}_ the function belongs in
- **body** is what to add in the source file body. **tabs and spaces are auto-managed**. Just focus on the newlines and spaces.

The above template if used produces the following:

```cpp
// class.h
private:
	// This goes in header above function
	virtual FRotator GetControlRotation() const override;

// source.h
FRotator AClass::GetControlRotation() const {
	if(GetPawn() != nullptr) {
		return FRotator(0.0f, GetPawn()->GetActorRotation().Yaw, 0.0f);
	}
	else {
		return FRotator(0.0f);
	}
}
```

If you make a good buildspace and submit to us, they will be available to the whole community and **you will be fully credited**.
Since we do not use servers, you will have to use our discord to submit them, where they will undergo a moderation check.

**Any updates to the API will be on us**. If we choose to customize the build API, **we will modify your buildspace for you**.
However, the credit will be retained permanently.
We would really appreciate a multiplayer buildspace from the community right now.

Anyways, that is all about extending the buildspace for now.

See you later... üñê
