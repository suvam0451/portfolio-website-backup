In this series, we will write a plugin for Unreal Engine 4 in rust programming language from start to finish. Steps would include

- **(Part-1)** C++ FFI, UE4 plug-in structure _(with third party dependencies)_, Short notes, Viability
- **(Part-2)** Rust-C++ interop (How is data passed between), Market shipping _(lib vs dll)_
- **(Part-3)** Engine Integration, Testing

#### First time set-up

Firstly, setting up rust toolchain. Skip this if you already have everything configured.
Below is a checklist of things you should already have.

1. rustup
2. vscode with **rust-rls** plug-in by rust-lang

#### Code

```rust
// Here is a list of structs we need and a basic empty function

struct SVector { x: f32, y: f32, z: f32 }

struct SQuat { w: f32, x: f32, y: f32, z: f32 }

struct STransform {
    position : SVector,
    location: SVector,
    rotaion: SQuat
}

pub extern fn RotateRightAngle(_transform : STransform) -> STransform {
}
```

The main takeaway is that C++ and rust allow static linking. This means we won't have to ship our library(DLL) along-side the game i.e- It will be built into the executable. This is important for procedurally generating world during runtime in shipped game.
If you only need world building in editor itself, perhaps this would be a better read for you.

Regardless, this series focuses on writing the module in rust, exposed as a third party **.lib**. We will be testing our functionalities outside the editor.
I have previously covered C++ for this. You can find that series below. If you already read that, you can skip any part you already know.

	body="This is useful to write procedural plug-ins (mostly calculation parts). You can write achieve the same with C++ as well."

#### C++ FFI

Without delving into technicalities, FFI(Foreign function interface) is used to run compiled code written in one language from another.
For our purpose, C++ uses FFI of C, which effectively means we would have to expose a C header for our functionalities written and compiled in rust.
We will use **cbindgen** for this purpose.

The first and foremost thing to consider writing a gamedev plug-in is the extensibility.
We want the ability to add/modify modules quickly while meeting the desired performance standard.
Rust is a pretty good option for this due to various reasons. Since you are here, you may have heard of few.

<Alert
	head="More about FFI !"
	body="Many languages support interop with C. But few allow static linking we need."

#### UE4 plug-in structure

Every plugin has the following structure.

#### Viability

Writing equivalent rust code was a good experience for me.
Overally, I had to write a bit more code and do more research because rust is pretty new to the market and not many documentation exist.
As you will see, passing data in between UE4 and rust needs a cumbersome API sitting in between.
However, once we are done with the API, we will find that adding further features is easier.

As for applying the codebase to other engines, we would need the data structures to be similar.
This might be unlikely in some cases, however favourable cases as mentioned below do exists.

#### Before we progress...

Learning rust in itself and working with interoperatibility might hamper professional production in the long run.
I am by no means a veteran dev. Throughout this series, we would mostly use static functions. I am hoping to by sharing my experience while developing my procedural plug-in.

Hopefully this will give you a head start in learning rust / plugin development. Good luck.
