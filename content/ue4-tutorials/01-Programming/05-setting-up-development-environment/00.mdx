### Introduction

In this module, we will be setting up the development environment for Unreal Engine 4. This means all the usual programming tools and a few plug-ins I find useful.

The upcoming sections will cover the following tools

1. The base engine installation
2. Editor Options(**_VS2019/VSCode_**)
3. Third-Party tools (**_IncrediBuild_**)
4. Version Control (**_gitlab/azure_**)

If hardware and storage is not an issue, just go through the series quickly to see if you missed any installation or faced any errors.
On the other hand, there are a few tips on where you might opt to skip a few installations that you might never use.

This guide goes in-depth with fixing any potential errors you might face. However, since I only have a windows laptop, the guide is applicablwe for **_windows users only_**.
That said, since VSCode is cross-platform, that section would be applicable to **_all OS users_**.

The reason why github is not covered is because there are plenty of tutorials available for it. Also, they offer a first party application in **_Github Desktop_**.
It is the most accessible platform and does not need command line git-bash knowledge at all.

Incredibuild is a tool I have been using for a few months that you might want to consider.
