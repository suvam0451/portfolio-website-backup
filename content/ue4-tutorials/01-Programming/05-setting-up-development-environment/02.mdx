#### Visual Studio 2019 for C++

In this module, we will be setting up the development environment for Unreal Engine 4. Thjat means everything except the engine and editor itself.
If you have a fast running PC with lightning fast compile times, then that is great.
But a large segment of users use slower PCs/laptops and thus the engine gets a bad name for heavily resource demaning.

- You have downloaded the engine from Epic launcher.
- You have downloaded [Visual studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and **_Community edition_**.

- JIT Debugger
- You'll need Profiling/CMake/ATL at some point, not for UE4 but for writing third party plugin codes.

If you game a lot, you should have these by default. If you don't,

1. you can download them here and here.
2. Use chocolatey package manager and
3. Install dev tools(some extra stuff) as shown below.

Throughout this series, I want to point out a few good practices and softwares through which your speed of development can improve.

**We will only be covering Windows** because I don't own a mac. Keybindings for vscode for example may be different.
