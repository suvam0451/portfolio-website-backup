In the previous part, we were introduced to Instanced Static Meshs Components (ISMC) and how to makeone spawn in C++ without issues.
In this part, we will use a map of ISMC to randomly populate a wall/fence.

To build a fence, we would need (I would provide for this tutorial):

- At least 2 models.
- The models must span along +ve X direction, starting at one corner-edge. _(Refer image below for modelling)_
- Planning ahead, the length of subunits.

![First milestone](../../../images/instanced-static-meshes/MeshOriginInstructions.png)

We already have the code for one ISMC, we just need a map here.

```cpp
// RandomizedWallActor.h (Better remove Tick/BeginPlay if not using.)
public:
	// Map of ISMC
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Parameters")
		TMap<int, UInstancedStaticMeshComponent*> ISMC_Map;

	// This is our map of meshes which would be used in ISMC Map
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Parameters")
		TMap<int, UStaticMesh*> MeshMap;

private:
	// Description not provided
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Category = "Parameters")
	USceneComponent *SceneRoot;

	virtual void OnConstruction(const FTransform &Transform) override;


// RandomizedWallActor.cpp

ARandomizedWallActor::ARandomizedWallActor()
{
 	// Set this actor to call Tick() every frame.  You can turn this off to improve performance if you don't need it.
	PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;

	// The reason we need this was covered in last part.
	SceneRoot = CreateDefaultSubobject<USceneComponent>("SceneRoot");
	RootComponent = SceneRoot;
}

void ARandomizedWallActor::OnConstruction(const FTransform &Transform)
{
	// Cleanup
	while (this->GetComponentByClass(UInstancedStaticMeshComponent::StaticClass()) != NULL)
	{
		UActorComponent *cls = this->GetComponentByClass(UInstancedStaticMeshComponent::StaticClass());
		cls->UnregisterComponent();
		cls->DestroyComponent();
		cls->SetActive(false);
	}

	for(int i = 0; i < MeshMap.Num(); i++) {
		ISMC_Map.Add(i, NewObject<UInstancedStaticMeshComponent>(this));
		ISMC_Map[i] = NewObject<UInstancedStaticMeshComponent>(this);
		ISMC_Map[i]->RegisterComponent();
		ISMC_Map[i]->AttachToComponent(RootComponent, FAttachmentTransformRules::KeepRelativeTransform);
		ISMC_Map[i]->SetStaticMesh(MeshMap[i]);
	}
}
```

Okay, few things to note:

- We have to populate **_ISMC_Map_** according to **_MeshMap_** before.
- If we have more boxes than we have balls, we will get a OutOfIndex exception. You get the idea.
- We covered **_cleanup_** last time. Next time, we will put that into its own function.

### Making the system designer friendly

Okay, you are in the editor. Everything _should_ work, but it doesn't. You can see the problem below.

![First milestone](../../../images/instanced-static-meshes/CannotAddNewKey.png)

**_Q: You have two hands full. You want to replace new item in one hand but can't drop any item. What do you do ?_**
You ask a friend to hold onto the item. Basically, ue4 is warning that a refresh will wipe your mesh reference(Map will be back to zero element).

We should actually not mess with adding/removing items directly. Lets make a function for that. At this point, it is better to give the designer **_an integer_** instead of this Map mess.

```cpp
// Added to RandomizedWallActor.h
	// Designer dictates number of meshes
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Parameters")
		int NumberOfMesh = 2;

	// This acts like a button to change map size
	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category="Parameters")
		bool Switch = false;

	// Updates the map size. TRIES to recover the previous values
	UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category="C++")
		void UpdateMapSize();
```

```cpp
// function declared in RandomizedWallActor.cpp
	void ARandomizedWallActor::OnConstruction(const FTransform &Transform) {
		// This will switch the function we made
		if (Switch = true) {
			UpdateMapSize();
			Switch = false;
		}
		// Rest of the code
	}

void ARandomizedWallActor::UpdateMapSize()
{
	// Copy the cleanup code here (Otherwise your ISMC Map will have different size. Not game-breaking but annoying.)
	// We don't need to nuke the references for MeshMap. They haven't used RegisterComponent();

	// The old switcharoo...
	TMap<int, UStaticMesh*> TemporaryMeshMap;
	TemporaryMeshMap = MeshMap;
	MeshMap.Empty();

	for(int i = 0; i < NumberOfMesh; i++) {
		MeshMap.Add(i, NewObject<UStaticMesh>(this));
	}

	// Attempt to recover the references.
	for(int i = 0; i < TemporaryMeshMap.Num(); i++) {
		if(i< MeshMap.Num()){
			MeshMap[i] = TemporaryMeshMap[i];
		}
	}

	// Kill the temp object( This is done automatically. Leaving it here to spread the good habit.)
	TemporaryMeshMap.Empty();
}
```

Few things to note here. Lets say your designer initially has 5 meshes set. If he changes the value to 3 and hits the button, 2 references will have to be readded.

- Its an easy fix but probably not worth it. You should know how many mesh you need.
- Pressing the boolean switch refreshes the maps. Moving the object fires OnConstruction. pretty neat, right ? I always use this workflow.
- Next important thing, you don't want that ISMC_Map to be editable in the first place. It should be completely covered in C++/Blueprints

```cpp
	// Completely hidden (Macros also optional.
	// If its an UObject not allocated via NewObject, you are good to go with ignoring macros and going vanilla C++)
	UPROPERTY()
		TMap<int, UInstancedStaticMeshComponent*> ISMC_Map;

	// ReadOnly. Will appear greyed out in details panel. If you use my plug-in, "uprop_ro" outputs this
	UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, Category="XYZ")
		TMap<int, UInstancedStaticMeshComponent*> ISMC_Map;
```

That was very long for getting the basic system in place. Trust me, it obliterates your mind when things don't spawn as ou expect. Next up, alternately spawning meshes.

#### Organizing groups of ISMC

Already covered spwaning ISMC last time. Add this to make them alternate.

```cpp
// Added to RandomizedWallActor.h (OnConstruction)
	if(MeshMap.Num() >=2){
		for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			if(i%2==0 && (ISMC_Map[0]->GetStaticMesh() != nullptr)){
				ISMC_Map[0]->AddInstance(FTransform(FVector(100.0f* i, 0,0)));
			}
			else if(ISMC_Map[0]->GetStaticMesh() != nullptr){
				ISMC_Map[1]->AddInstance(FTransform(FVector(100.0f* i, 0,0)));
			}
		}
	}
```

Next up we want the spawning to be procedural and **_respect the lengths_** we give per mesh object. That, we shall cover in the next part.
It's been a lot of exercise and I am sure some bug might pop up from older engines at this point. Also, we will be moving some repeating code to their own functions.

#### Check-In üìã

Make sure you have something like this going for you.

If you did the alternating exercise, you should have something like this.

![Results](../../../images/instanced-static-meshes/End-02-01.png)

If you skipped, make sure to check back with the **_cleanup codes_** and colored sections. They will be useful if you are stuck.

In the next segment, we will add a pseudo random generator and implement the length criteria. Then we will refactor the code to make it more clean and that will be all for a ISM basic.
I will continue to make advanced tutorials, but this series will be listed as a dependency before going through that.

See you later... üñê

#### (~~Promo~~) My VSCode plug-in

You can use `uprop` to create public properties. `uprop_ro` to create readonly properties.

![uprop](../../../images/instanced-static-meshes/Promo01.gif)

Also, snippets for code we are going to use a lot in this series. Below shown `uinit_ismc_map`. There are similar snippets for MeshMap and similar used in rapid procedural prototyping in C++.

![uinit_ismc](../../../images/instanced-static-meshes/Promo03.gif)

You can also get a set of headers included without looking up docs (`include_procedural`, `include_spline`)
