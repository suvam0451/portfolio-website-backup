It can be quite bothersome to deal with git collaborations for an artist or modeller. It is often more convenient to just version out files manually in your computer. However, using git in everyday projects is encouraged and here are some things you can do with the git.

#### As an artist

1. You can save **versions** of your work(Although its not much different from local versioning).
2. **Permanent storage**.
3. Most git services allow **online file viewing**.
4. Free **heavily structured storage**. Rare to lose files due to fuck-ups, really.
5. Also, `your programmer will be happy.`.

#### As a modeler

1. ^ Above mentioned
2. You can setup basic tests to see if you missed to export/over-exported objects.
3. Also, `your programmer will be happy`.

#### As a programmer

1. Where do i even start... ?
2. Commit history to **track changes**
3. **Boards** similar to trello for organization
4. Webhooks, DevOps, Automation, Docker, Kubernetes(_Not covered here_)

The idea is not to have a organized project structure with pretty commit history and multiple running branches deploying on your remote servers and automatically notifying you while you work on a cheap ass laptop from a cafe while on your vacation.

Okay, i agree that it is not lucrative for modelers and artists...

But we just want to have a safe net to fall back to when our code has bugs we don't understand or when we delete important files (**god forbid!!**)

With git, roll-back changes, everything works fine again, start whatever self-torture you were indulging in xD
With this reference page, you will

1. Setup a Gitlab account(**Git bash doesn't care about provider**).
2. Make a repo and do some file transfers between pc and server.
3. Setup branches and do some housekeeping
4. Implement the simplest collaboration pipeline.
