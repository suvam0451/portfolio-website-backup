We will cover the following most popular ways to author shaders in Unreal Engine 4.

- **1. Node Editor**
- **2. Meterial Functions**
- **3. HLSL syntax with .usf/.ush**
- **4. With C++ using FExpressions**

In the consequent sections, you can find a few examples of writing the following
material using the above listed methods. Hopefully you get a broader picture of what to expect
and at what efforts. We will cover each method in one section to each section.

- Hello there.
- Sample content.

```javascript
import React from "react";

const Counter = initialCounter => {
	const [counter, setCounter] = React.useState(initialCounter);

	const onIncrement = () => {
		setCounter(c => c + 1);
	};

	const onIncrement = () => {
		setCounter(c => c - 1);
	};

	return (
		<div>
			{counter}

			<div>
				<button onClick={onIncrement} type="button">
					Increment
				</button>
				<button onClick={onDecrement} type="button">
					{" "}
					// highlight-line Decrement
				</button>
			</div>
		</div>
	);
};

export default Counter;
```
