##### 1. Not a git repository
---
`fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git`

Possible causes:
- The folder from where you started your terminal is not a git repository(*you can check for a hidden .git folder*).
- You cloned a repo and started started inserting commands into same terminal.

Solution:
- After cloning, close terminal and `right click->git bash here` from inside the new folder that got created.
- Your folder is not a git repo. *(Maybe you downloaded the project as zip file instead of cloning?)*
