In this page, we will discuss how to

1. Configure our visual studio environment.
2. Produce valid DLLs/LIBs.

If you have not yet set-up visual studio, please **visit set-up VS for UE4**. You will need it, for the code least. Or optionally, you can check this page for **settings up with VS Code**.
```cpp
+dllmain.cpp
```

- As per docs, UE4 needs DLL code genereted in **Release mode**.
- Target platform should be **x64**. Just as a note, if you were to use features similar to DLLs for android/linux/mac, the process is similar but you will need different compilers. More about that in discussions.
