import { Footer, Alert } from "../../../src/components/Decorations";

Welcome to third part of this series. We are creating a **reusable health system using interfaces** in C++ and use that on many actors.
It will be an ActorComponent.
If you haven't read the first part yet, do so. Second part is not required.

For a health system, we would need,
- CurrentHealth (preferrable with getters and setters)
- Damage and Heal functions

### Health system interface
---

Following what we discussed before, We start with the following code. (Removing the obvious #include sections)

```cpp
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// UWW_HealthInterface.h

UCLASS()
class XYZ_API UWW_HealthInterface : public UInterface {
	GENERATED_BODY()
};

class XYZ_API IWW_IBaseSceneComponent {
	GENERATED_BODY()
public:
	UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, BlueprintNativeEvent, Category = "Overrides")
	int ReduceHealth(int Value); // will reduce HP, returns 1 if HP below zero
	UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, BlueprintNativeEvent, Category = "Overrides")
	int AddHealth(int Value); // will increase HP, returnas 1 if HP overflows
};
```

We implement this in an ActorComponent. This time we *don't need to spawn it in world*, so a ActorComponent suffices.

```cpp
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Appended to UActorComponent_HP.h

public:
	// Called when any component property is modified in inspector
	virtual void PostEditChangeProperty(FPropertyChangedEvent &PropertyChangedEvent) override;

	UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite)
	int Health = 0;

	UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, BlueprintNativeEvent, Category = "Override")
	int ReduceHealth(int Value);
	UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, BlueprintNativeEvent, Category = "Override")
	int AddHealth(int Value);
	virtual void ReduceHealth_Implementation() override;
	virtual void AddHealth_Implementation() override;

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Appended to UActorComponent_HP.cpp

void UActorComponent_H::PostEditChangeProperty(FPropertyChangedEvent &PropertyChangedEvent) {
	Execute_AddHealth(this, 30);
	Execute_ReduceHealth(this, 20);
}

int UActorComponent_H::ReduceHealth_Implementation(int Value) {
	UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Interface ReduceHealth is not implemented."));
}
int UActorComponent_H::AddHealth_Implementation(int Value) {
	UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Interface AddHealth is not implemented."));
}
```

- **My Create blueprint class from XYZ is greyed out. Where did I go wrong ?**
- We covered this. change `UCLASS(ClassGroup = (Custom), meta = (BlueprintSpawnableComponent))` or whatever is there to `UCLASS(Blueprintable)` in `UActorComponent_HP.h`

#### observations:
- Note that we added a health property in header.
- If we don't implement anything and compile it anyways, & then go and create a blueprint and assign it to an actor, it seems we are still able to override the functions.
- This is pretty cool because usually one would expect C++ top kick you out if you don't implement every single function.
- I will test and update if this has any side effects.

After this is done, compile and jump to blueprint. Override the 2 interfaces, drag and attach the property and increment/decrement by value. It is a very simple exercise.
It will add 2 functions. If you have difficulty, just fire up the included example. C++ guys can just write out the code in XYZ_Execute functions.
To kill the actor, use (From ActorCompoennt code)

That was all the basics covered. I hope you consider including abstract C++ interfaces in your future projects.
Anything new added to this series will feature integrating other important features (like GameplayAbilitySystem, ThirdPartyPlugins).
You can always check for additional posts from the [module page](/tutorials/ue4/interfacing-cpp-and-blueprints) or [homepage](/).
